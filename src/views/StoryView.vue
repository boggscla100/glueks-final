      Gluek’s is inspired by one of Minneapolis’s historic beer halls, with brick arches,
      long wooden tables, and a lively downtown crowd. The origin of Gluek’s Bar & Restaurant can be traced back to 1855, when brewer Gottlieb Gluek arrived in Minneapolis from his native Germany. By 1857, he established the Mississippi Brewery at Marshall and 22nd Street NE and later changed the name to the Gluek Brewing Company. As Minneapolis grew, so did the brewery, producing a variety of beers including Gluek’s beer, Glix Beer, Gluek’s Stite and Pioneer Beer.

      Tragically, just a decade later, much more extensive restoration would be required. In April 1989, a massive fire completely gutted the interior, claiming the lives of three tenants living upstairs. After nearly 90 years of service, a charred brick shell was all that remained of one Minneapolis oldest and most recognized restaurants.
      The decision to rebuild was immediate. Construction proceeded with the intention to recreate as closely as possible the distinctive Bavarian beer hall design, including the floor plan, detailed woodwork, stained glass and famous vaulted ceilings. The exterior was restored by November 1989 and the interior renovated in time for a February 1, 1990 reopening.
      The past decade has been a period of rebirth for Gluek’s Bar & Restaurant. While the bar remains as popular as ever, the restaurant is emerging as one of the most comfortable and satisfying dining experiences in the Warehouse District. Our special blend of history, culture and contemporary spirit has make Gluek’s a choice meeting place for generations
